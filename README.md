# Stock Price Tracker

App checks stock price on Yahoo Finance and if that price falls below or equals your desired price for that stock an email will be sent as a reminder. The app uses an excel file to hold all of the stock URLs and your set price for them. Each stock will be checked and a daily report will be sent via email of the stock prices that have met the desired price that you set.

## How It Works

Uses openpyxl to extract all information regarding sender email, receiver email, user-agent, stock URLs and their desired prices from excel file. Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape Yahoo Finance for the stock price. Compiles report based on comparing stock price with desired price and sends out report daily to the receiver email address.
